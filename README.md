# Merge_Excel_Files_Python
Merge Excel files using Python (Join Operations).
This code works in case you have to find if entries in one column matches or not but you have two seperate files possibly in different formats which are unarranged with one or more columns same.

Please note- you can get to create the DataFrame using a CSV file also, in that case please change the Code to df1 = pd.read_excel to df1 = pd.read_csv.
df stands for Data Frame.
